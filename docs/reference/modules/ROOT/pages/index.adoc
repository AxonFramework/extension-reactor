:navtitle: Reactor Extension
= Reactor

Overlooking Axon Frameworks architecture, you can notice that in general systems using the framework are "Message Driven", "Responsive", "Resilient" and "Elastic". According to link:https://www.reactivemanifesto.org/[Reactive Manifesto,window=_blank,role=external], the same holds for Reactive Systems in general.

Although we can state that Axon Framework is a type of reactive system, we can't say that it is fully reactive.

NOTE: Reactive programming is an approach to writing software that embraces asynchronous I/O. Asynchronous I/O is a small idea that portends big changes for software. The idea is simple: alleviate inefficient resource utilization by reclaiming resources that would otherwise be idle, as they waited for I/O activity. Asynchronous I/O inverts the normal design I/O processing: the clients are notified of new data instead of asking for it, which frees the client to do other work while waiting for these notifications.

By their nature, a reactive API and Axon are a great fit, as most of framework's operations are async and non-blocking. Providing a dedicated extension for this was thus a logical step to take. To that end, we chose to use Pivotalâ€™s link:https://projectreactor.io/[Project Reactor,window=_blank,role=external] to build this extension. Reactor builds on top of the link:https://www.reactive-streams.org/[Reactive Streams specification,window=_blank,role=external] and is the de-facto standard for Java enterprise and Spring applications. As such, we feel it to be a great fit to provide an extension in, making Axon more reactive.

NOTE: Not all Axon components offer a reactive API, yet. We will incrementally introduce more "reactiveness" to this extension, giving priority to components where users can benefit the most.

To use the link:https://github.com/AxonFramework/extension-reactor[Axon Reactor Extension,window=_blank,role=external], make sure that `axon-reactor` module is available on the classpath.
